# test-repository

I am making some edits to this file using Markdown! 

## This is a level 2 heading
I can use a simple text formatting to make **bold** or *italic* texts 

***woah*** this is **bold** and *italic* 

### Now I'm using a level 3 heading

#### what does level 4 look like?

Now I'm making edits in a different branch

**Make some bold text** followed by some *italic texts* 

# Then use a big header...
